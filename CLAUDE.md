# manga-tracker — Claude Code Briefing

> Human+Claude workflow guide: `docs/workflow.md`.
> Shared agent rules for Codex + Claude: `docs/agent-workflow.md`.

> Recommended split: use Claude for PRD/planning and independent second review, then Codex for implementation/testing/fixes.

## What This Project Is

A manga reading tracker: users add manga URLs, the backend scrapes for new chapters, and the frontend shows a reading dashboard. Stack: **Spring Boot 3 + Angular 22 + PostgreSQL**, deployed via Docker Compose.

## Directory Map

```
backend/        Spring Boot 3 (Gradle, Java 21, Jakarta EE 10)
frontend/       Angular 22 (standalone components, SCSS, Playwright E2E)
docs/           API reference, architecture, developer guide, workflow, change log
ralph/          Ralph autonomous agent system (PRD-driven iteration)
skills/         Project-specific skills and repo-owned workflows
tasks/          PRD outputs and techdebt reports
```

## Available Skills (`skills/`)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `domain-modeling` | Actively maintain the project's domain model — challenge terms, invent edge cases, record ADRs |
| `grill-with-docs` | Relentless interview to sharpen a plan/design while generating ADRs + glossary |
| `handoff` | Compact the current conversation into a handoff doc for a fresh agent to continue |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | Scan for shallow-module refactors (deepening opportunities) aligned with the domain model |
| `teach` | Stateful, multi-session learning workspace (missions, glossary, learning records) |
| `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` | Extremely strict maintainability review: abstraction quality, giant files, spaghetti conditions |

> The earlier planning/review skills (`/prd`, `/ralph`, `/techdebt`, `/review`, `/supervise`, etc.)
> were moved out of this repo. Use the equivalents from your global skill set when referenced below.

## Two-Agent Loop

Default supervised flow:
1. Claude plans
2. Codex implements
3. Codex self-reviews
4. Claude independently reviews with `/supervise`
5. If both agree it is ready, push
6. If they agree it is blocked, Codex fixes and both re-review
7. If they disagree, stop and reconcile before fixing or pushing

Planning artifact rule:
- Use `/prd` for medium/large features or ambiguous scope.
- Use `tasks/plan-template.md` for the implementation handoff and review contract.
- Small, clear bug fixes can skip the PRD and go straight to a task plan.

## Non-Negotiable Conventions

These cause CI failures or runtime errors if violated:

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| `jakarta.persistence.*` — never `javax.persistence.*` | Spring Boot 3 uses Jakarta EE 10 |
| `ddl-auto=validate` — always add a Flyway migration | Hibernate validates schema on startup; no auto-DDL |
| Never edit or delete existing Flyway migrations | Checksum mismatch will block startup |
| `inject()` function — never constructor injection | ESLint `@angular-eslint/prefer-inject` enforced |
| Run `spotlessApply` before committing Java changes | CI rejects unformatted code |
| New features use TDD — one test, make it pass, repeat. No horizontal slicing (all tests first then all code) | Tests drive design; ensures behavior coverage and prevents speculative code |

## Quality Gate Commands

Run these before pushing:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
./gradlew spotlessApply          # Auto-format Java
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport  # Unit + integration tests + coverage

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run format                   # Prettier auto-fix
npm test                         # Vitest unit tests
npm run lint                     # ESLint check
npm run e2e                      # Playwright E2E (mocked, no backend needed)
```

## Testing Notes

- Backend integration tests use **Testcontainers** — Docker must be running.
- Frontend E2E tests use **Playwright** with mocked backend (no real server needed for `e2e/manga.spec.ts`).
- Integration E2E (`e2e/integration.spec.ts`) requires full stack via `./run-e2e-integration.sh`.

## Ralph System — Read Before Touching

The `ralph/` directory contains an autonomous agent system. **Do not modify `ralph/CLAUDE.md`, `ralph/prd.json`, or `ralph/progress.txt`** unless you are running a Ralph session or explicitly asked to. These files drive multi-iteration autonomous execution.

## Browser Verification

For any UI change, verify in browser using Playwright MCP tools:
1. Ensure the app is running (`dev.sh` or `docker compose up`)
2. Navigate to the affected page
3. Interact with the feature and take a screenshot
4. Save screenshot to `/tmp/<description>.png`
